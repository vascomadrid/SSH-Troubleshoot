# Ping
Ping is a simple tool to check if you can send packets and receive packets from the server. 
If you are able to send and recieve packets then it is likely the problem isn't with connection or another 
service you are using like a VPN or virtual machine. 
In this folder I have some scripts using ping from two virtual machines along with comments clarifying how to read output and how the script works.
